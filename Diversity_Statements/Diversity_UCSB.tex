% 250 word 
% UC Santa Barbara is interested in a diverse and inclusive graduate student population. Please describe any aspects of your personal background, accomplishments, or achievements that you feel are important in evaluating your application for graduate study. For example, please describe if you have experienced economic challenges in achieving higher education, such as being financially responsible for family members or dependents, having to work significant hours during undergraduate schooling or coming from a family background of limited income. Please describe if you have any unusual or varied life experiences that might contribute to the diversity of the graduate group, such as fluency in other languages, experience living in bicultural communities, academic research interests focusing on cultural, societal, or educational problems as they affect underserved segments of society, or evidence of an intention to use the graduate degree toward serving disadvantaged individuals or populations.

% I want to work on maching sure machine learning models do not adversely affect marginalized population of people

I am a minority in the United States -- racially as an Asian American. I grew up in an area where the majority of people did not look like me and had to constantly deal with cultural clashes, e.g. being the only one in school without a Halloween costume since my parents didn't deem it necessary to get one. When I was younger, I disliked this fact and wished I was a ``normal" person -- and that I could look just like the white people that were around me.

However, as I grew older, I started more and more accepting myself for who I am. For one, I realized my experience has made me more sensitive and empathetic to cultural difference and mindful of marginalized groups of people. Furthermore, as I learned more about the people around me, I also became cognizant of the many otherwise in which I was greatly privileged. For example, my parents have the capability to support me through university financially, so I never had to worry about economic challenges. Similarly, compared to my international friends who must worry about visas and greencards so that they can stay in the United States, my citizenship was given to me at birth. Or lastly, as a man, I have less of a need to worry about discrimination or harassment in the workplace when compared to women.



% As an minority in the United States -- specifically a Chinese American, my experiences growing up has emphasized to me the need of promoting diversity in education. More specifically, I am a second-generation immigrant who grew up in a predominantly-white neighborhood and have first hand experience of the difficulties one can experience when they are ``different" from the majority group -- both through the inadvertent micro-aggression and cultural differences. At the same time, the minority experience has afforded me the ability to have a greater appreciation for multiculturalism and empathy for other minority groups. I've lived in China for a year when I was younger, and this has given me a different perspective from some of my pears who grew up entirely in the United States.

% At the same time, I am aware that although I racially am a minority, in many other ways I have been greatly privileged. Firstly, as a man in the STEM field, I do not have to worry as much about work discrimination that other women may face. Similarly, I am financially secure enough with my parent's support, that I do not have to worry monetarily about school and thus can explore and find my passion at my own pace. My sexual orientation and gender identity also all fall within the societally perceived ``norm". This has made me cognizant of the fact that there are many societal issues that others deal with on a daily basis that I do not have to worry about. Thus, my identity both as a minority in some ways and societally privileged in other ways, has distilled in me the importance of ensuring accessibility and equity.

To promote inclusion, I am currently trying to make machine learning more accessible to others. Specifically, I hold machine learning workshops at the data science club at my college open to everyone. Through this I hope to lower the barrier of entry and bring more people into this field. Similarly, this has partially motivated my research interest of fair and explainable ML models. I believe ML will have an outsized impact on society in the future, and it is important to guarantee that the models will not discriminate against marginalized groups.

% I have also attempted to become a more open-minded person by interacting with more international students at my school. And hence a majority of my friends are from all over the world. Through them, I have gained exposure to various different cultures and have gained a better picture of the vastly different experiences that people can have. I believe this sensitivity is also something of value that I can bring to the University of Minnesota.
% I am asian american -- a minority in America
    % Priviledged -- my parents have been willing to support me -- allow me to find and develop my own passion
    % I believe equity and fairness is important -- part of the reason why this is the line of research I want to pursue in machine learning -- insure models are equitable to people of all types
    % Second generation immigrant
        % most of my friends are international students -- broaden my understanding of people from different cultures
    % making machine learning and deep learning more acessible to others, I hold workshops at the datascience club in my school to bring more people into the field.
