%For research interests and experience -- pull from UMN SOP

% To help admissions committees in these departments/degree programs identify prospective students, the Machine Learning @ UW encourages you to clearly state your research interests in the statement of purpose and note your interest in being part of the Machine Learning @ UW. We also strongly recommend that you contact potential graduate advisors by e-mail to discuss your research interests prior to application review.

%I think I need GRE for this school

I specifically am applying to University of Wisconsin Madison due to its strong focus on machine learning i.e. Machine Learning @ UW-Madison. Specifically I would like to work with professors such as Sharon Yixuan Li (DICE \cite{sun2022dice} or nearst neighbor OOD \cite{sun2022knn}), Yong Jae Lee (W2D \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.04384}, \cite{wang2022toward}) and Junjie Hu (mix in domain and out of domain \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2106.11375}, lexicon induction \cite{hu-etal-2019-domain-adaptation}). All three professors have done work in regards to distribution shift and how to identify it or train robust models against it. r st
